# Want to get into Product Management?

This will outline why you might want to reconsider that.

To P or not to P? (Sorry, I thought it too clever to not use it)

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôd love to connect with you to understand how I can get into Product Management.‚Äù

To which, my standard response is, ‚ÄúWhy Product Management?‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt think of myself as the gatekeeper to product management careers but from the spectrum of reasons I get, I see a common theme of mismatched expectations.

Product management can be a really fulfilling career but it is not without its own set of challenges. Don‚Äôt jump on the product wagon without understanding the effort it takes to being one.

While I started this essay as a rant to the world, I‚Äôve tried by best to add helpful reads that you can go through to get a better understanding of each of the major sections covered here. There are a number of caveats that aren‚Äôt fully covered here. However, an extremely important one is that Product Management as it stands today is relatively new and the expectations vary widely across industries, growth stages, funding stages, company structures. Take what you think makes sense and discard what doesn‚Äôt (also, help me understand why, I‚Äôd love to hear your experience).

`Note`: All the views expressed here are my own and are purely based on my experience in Product and some from a few debates discussions around some of these topics. I am no authority on the subject, domain and I‚Äôm still quite young in my career and acknowledge that some or a lot of this could change in the future. :)

### Expectation 1: I get to own the entire product and build really cool stuff.

#### Reality: You don‚Äôt (always) own the roadmap. You own the execution.

People have this common notion that PMs actually own the roadmap and that‚Äôs rarely ever the case. The road to being more invested in strategic decisions is a long one. The roadmap is driven by Founders, CXOs in smaller organisations and a head of product in companies that have the hierarchy in place. Now, like a few others, I have had the fortune of contributing to the roadmap building but this is an exception and not a rule.

It also matters what defines your company‚Äôs growth - is it a sales-led, product-led or engineering-led company? This is a crucial step in understanding the level of ownership that will come your way. Needless to say, a product manager in a product-led company has the most influence among the three types but the general idea around all three types is to ensure you‚Äôre doing right by your users and ergo, the product & company.

Additionally, it is also dependant on the stage of your company. In early or growth stage companies, you often wear multiple hats and you could get the opportunity to build a roadmap. So, if this is something you‚Äôre chasing, ensure you pick the right stage of the company.

### Expectation 2: I get full ownership of the product and all the decisions around it.

#### Reality: You don‚Äôt get to take unilateral decisions. You‚Äôre a facilitator of decisions.

Users. First.

Conviction. Second.

Consensus. Third.

You don‚Äôt own the product. Your users do. You‚Äôre merely helping build the right product for them.

A large part of your role demands you to have conviction on the suggestions you push. You should be able to justify this with qualitative and quantitative data. As a PM, your role demands you to get everyone on the same page. It goes through several internal teams before you can actually start the development work.

Don‚Äôt rally for a role in Product with the assumption that you‚Äôll be the CEO of the product. There is no such thing. You‚Äôre yet another enthusiastic elf who wants to help Santa. üôÇ

### Expectation 3: PMs don‚Äôt really have targets. So, it‚Äôs a chill role and I can wing it.

#### Reality: Well, ding ding ding! We do have targets. Just not what you might be used to.

Depending on the stage of the company and the type of product you‚Äôre building, your metrics would differ.

For example, at an early stage company, I was measured by the increase in user base. At the growth stage, I‚Äôm measured by the increase in users, retention and feature adoption. I‚Äôm also measured on how happy users are with the product.

Products that are transactional in nature tend to have revenue goals for their PMs along with other base metrics laid out above.

In essence, you are measured. Your job is not just to ship something but also measure its success and ensure adoption.

### Expectation 4: It‚Äôs a relatively stress-free environment given I just have to tell people what to do.

#### Reality: You need to work well in stressful situations. You need to be able to take good decisions most of the time. Also, It‚Äôs influence over authority.

Life in Product is anything but stress-free. I don‚Äôt mean to scare folks away but it‚Äôs important to know that this is a function that facilitates & drives a lot of the decision making.

It also demands you to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù often to a lot of people and ruthlessly take calls that benefit the user.

It‚Äôs a role that truly embodies influence over authority. You don‚Äôt (always) have an independent team that reports into you to build features out. Your core skill is to ensure you communicate the `Why` and `What` of any product decision you‚Äôre taking to ensure every stakeholder is aligned.

It is never about ‚Äútelling people what needs to be done‚Äù. It‚Äôs about bringing everyone together to solve really good problems and ensuring you do that with conviction, data, validation with the least amount of biases for the most part.

### Expectation 5: The day-to-day is predictable and I just have to work on building good product specs.

#### Reality: There‚Äôs no single routine - you‚Äôll have unpredictable day and there‚Äôs a whole lot of context switching.

The truth of the matter is that you‚Äôre not just responsible for building good features but also maintaining them. You‚Äôll have days that are meeting-free and then some with absolutely no deep-focus time.

So, the day-to-day life of a product manager is far from predictable.

In most companies, you‚Äôre expected to assist with troubleshooting, debugging production issues, providing customer support, attend meetings, and clarifying product specifications. This is a part of your job simply because you‚Äôre the subject matter expert for the features, flows and metrics you own.

And the tone, context and nature of these calls can be erratic. Most often, you‚Äôre required to switch between these tasks rapidly, which can make it difficult to maintain focus and productivity. There‚Äôs a whole lot of context switching. And this isn‚Äôt specific to PMs, I‚Äôm sure.

Owning to the highly cross-functional nature of the role, there‚Äôs always more to do than you anticipate or can plan for. Some are natural multitaskers and handle context-switching gracefully and some train themselves to get there. Understand where you stand and whether this is something you truly want to learn to do before you step in.

### Expectation 6: It‚Äôs a high-thinking role and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm good at

#### Reality: It‚Äôs an execution heavy role & a coordination heavy function

Product management and project management are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. A lot of articles sell you the trope that product management is focused on strategy and vision, while project management is focused on execution and delivery. This is not true at all for most companies. The only ones that can afford to form this segregation are very large conglomerates.

In early and growth stages, a large part of product management _is_ project management. And rightly so. Product managers are responsible for the entire product lifecycle, from ideation to launch and beyond.

Product management and project management are two sides of the same coin. And in cases where you have the luxury of segregation, product managers and project managers still work very closely towards the same goal. The intersection of product management and project management is where the magic happens. It is where great products are created, and user needs are met.

### Expectation 7: It‚Äôs a high-paying job!

#### Reality: Well, it can be. But it might not necessarily be.

While it is true that product managers can earn six-figure salaries in many areas, this is not always the case. One of the main reasons why a career in product management might not be high paying is that average salaries for this role vary widely.

For example, product managers in the software industry tend to earn more than those in other industries, such as retail or healthcare. Additionally, geography plays a huge role in arriving at these figures - a product manager in tech hubs like Bangalore or San Francisco tend to earn more than product managers elsewhere. There‚Äôs a huge difference in earning potential even between Bangalore and San Francisco.

Product management is a relatively new field, and there is not yet a well-defined career path for professionals to follow. So, the skillsets for the same are largely unknown and hence, over or unvalued based on biases that the companies and respective hiring authorities hold.

## Conclusion

I‚Äôve tried to paint as real a picture I can with what little I have come to realise with my experience. I am sure that you can switch out ‚Äúproduct management‚Äù from this essay with another role and most or parts of this might still hold true.

While a career in product management can be highly rewarding, it is important to have a realistic view of the role. Like most roles, this is one with its own circus of wonders and complexities. Just figure out the kind of circus you want to deal with and your place in the circus. :)

I‚Äôm also going to leave you with an article that made me think very differently about this role. It‚Äôs a very interesting take on the role itself.

I'd love to hear from you if you feel differently about any of these points or if this helped you navigate a decision to take up this role. :)
