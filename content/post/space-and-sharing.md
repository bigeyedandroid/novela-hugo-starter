# Space and Sharing

[_Image Source: Mortal Feelings by Ibiyinka Alao_]()

She read and re-read the last line of a post hoping somehow that it wouldn’t come to an end.

She clung to those last lines as one would to the empty packet of chips until the last bits of _masala_ were licked clean. She wondered how cruel it would be if she didn’t share this with anyone. It was her vain attempt at keeping the author to herself. Just for a while longer. Claiming this feeling as her own and no one else’s to experience. She wondered how she got this way. Incidentally, she found herself in the same room she once locked herself in a decade ago. Without wanting to revisit the emotion, she felt herself drifting.

She slammed her door shut as if claiming the space as her own. While in reality, it was the house’s common bathroom. As bold as her act was, all she wanted to do was weep. Weep about everything that was wrong with the world, well, her world at least. She felt the hot tears burn her with shame and the guilt of just wanting to cry. “Stop! stop! stop! “, she screamed at her tears in a reflection of herself. She was yet to debate the logic of screaming at something that can’t hear or respond. In her own space, she cried her heart and shame out knowing full well that she didn’t have an audience to judge or see the streamy mess of _kajal_ and sunscreen.

After her raspy breath and string of tears finally reached a less frequent occurrence, she sat and wondered why crying always makes you hungry. While she was raging mad at the prospect of getting outside and meeting the eyes of the very person who made her want to lock herself in, her stomach wouldn’t let her have it.

She wondered what _Amma_ would have kept in the cheat-food basket this week. Last week, she tricked us with a big pack of diet _chivda_. We couldn't admit that it was quite yummy after the fit we threw about _chivda_ having no real qualities to classify as a proper cheat meal.

She drew circles on the ground with her feet until she realised it was only making her stomach groan louder. She debated the heavy loss she’d yield in this almost real cold war if she were to step out and finally gave in. She opened the door ever so lightly just to see if everyone else anticipated her opening the door in less than 8 minutes. Who even knew you could actually stop crying by screaming at the tears?

She walked out with a feline hop straight into the kitchen, hoping to possibly run back in with a snack or two. She lasted exactly 10 seconds before her elder sister caught her. Her stance immediately changed to that of a warrior ready to fight it out. Being the youngest in a family of 5 isn’t an easy feat. You find ways to prove to everyone else that you’re tough. Especially if you have rowdy siblings trying to prove their own adolescent bravery any chance they could.

She watched her sister give her a stern look before sighing and submitting an apology that felt forced. She wondered what brought this on and as if her sister read her mind, replied, “_Amma_ made me, just so you know! My drawer is still off the limits. If I ever so much as even catch you trying to pry it open, I’ll make sure you pay”. She felt her tears fighting to come out again. “Stop” she screamed in her head and they listened to her again.

She felt the feeling of not having a space to call her own, of not belonging to a family of 5 very different people and an intense hatred to share anything she had or felt with anyone else. They ended this fight by sharing the same drawer again but this time, labelling each section their own.

This fight among many others started her trait of not wanting to share anything again. She chuckled at the memory, which again remained unshared. She always fought the impulse to hide her favourite books and posts among other things wanting to claim them as her own. A feeling she was so used to now. Only this time, a little shy of 23, she decided she was too old to be this way.

She walked out and quickly walked to her makeshift work desk before she changed her mind. Her laptop greeted her with the usual creak and several pings indicating an interesting work debate as if what she’d decided to do was not hard enough already, without all these distractions. With steely-eyed determination, she got around to composing an email with the link to the post and sent it to her usual bunch of which her sister is a part now.

Right after, almost involuntarily, her feet took her to the kitchen. The cheat basket resides on a different shelf now, she noticed. The cheat basket never seemed to have a problem being the shared space for all our guilty eats, she noted. With a smile on her face, she made a mental list of all the things she was finally ready to share as she bit into a very approved slice of plum cake.
