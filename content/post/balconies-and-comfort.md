My auto took the usual Uru-Pimento-VegaCity road on my way back from the office last night. Pimento is that big cylindrical building with a helipad right next to Uru that I stare at every time we go past it. Possibly for the want of things fancier than one has.

Pointless facts aside, it got me thinking about how each of us live such different lives and you can almost, just almost guess the story from looking at the way people keep their balconies.

Some are kempt with lush shrubs, herbs and creepers. Almost letting people believe the perfect lives they lead. Perfect, lush and green. With a neat little swing to cosy up in with your coffee and book on a rainy, miserable day.

And there are the ubiquitous pigeon poop-stained ones. These are my second favourite ones. Reminds me of my own home. We had empty pots laid out for pigeons to come, do their business and then grow their little chicks with us. The stench of it all is unbearable. But nothing else feels like home.

And then there are ones that were once perfect, lush and green. I feel sad for these ones. No one should feel as neglected as they do. Almost like the middle child in an unfortunately dysfunctional family.

And then for my last and favourite one, the empty ones. I somehow really enjoy the empty ones. They make no fuss. They don't try too hard to let the world know who they are or who they should be. They are just empty and okay with it. It's easy to like simple things.

Every time I cross this road, I sometimes make up little stories for silhouettes of people through the balcony windows (or any window for that matter). One always wonders about things that donâ€™t necessarily concern them. An act of acquiring information that we think we are always privy to. As I type it, I see that I'm coming across as a stalker, albeit, a very useless and harmless one. We always want to know more than we do. Sometimes, nothing is ever enough. But it's fun to do these things. Makes you wonder what kind of balcony you're going to end up with.

If we're lucky, we find ones that will make us feel at home and cosy in our own right. And make some random person in a moving vehicle wonder about how (im)perfect each of our lives could be.
