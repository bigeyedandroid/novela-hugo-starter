Growing up, I always saw my *Thatha* as my hero. He was a tall man with a dynamic personality. He could crack up any room with a simple wordplay. You could hear him guffaw along with the rest of the audience who’d be in splits.

*Thatha*, in his bachelor days, was a part of a real-fancy drama troupe. On some boring summer afternoons, he’d tell us stories about the characters they played, the awards they’ve won and the famous people they’ve met. These were always his favourite stories to tell us.

It probably reminded him of all the things he had to leave behind to marry my *Paati*. Now, don’t get me wrong. They were not forced to marry each other and were wonderfully happy together, however, leaving his dreams of becoming an actor was a prerequisite to marrying my *Paati*.

The condition stemmed from an insecurity. You see, back then, actors led radically different lives from those that followed the social norms of, well, living. There were always speculations on the street or printed articles about actors marrying their 3rd wife or having extra marital affairs and how the other wives were simply okay with it. Were they forced to be okay with it? One can only guess.

My *Paati’s* family was very sure that they didn’t want that for their little girl; and rightly so.

*Thatha’s* family agreed to make this happen and a few months later, *Thatha* and *Paati* had a simple ceremony to tie the knot. Even though he had let a significant part of his life go, he continued to be the same charming, baritone-voiced, funny guy. He had found different goals to focus on.

As a shy, skinny kid, who didn’t always fit in, I used to watch in fascination how he’d get an entire room to listen to him with undivided attention. Not a single head turned away from his ever-smiling face. He would always try really hard to stop chuckling at his own joke. I’d be right there putting my head against his big belly waiting for the laughter to begin. I found comfort in that sound.

I would always listen to an endless train of compliments for my *Thatha* from people we know, people who’d just met him, people who thought he looked like someone famous, and even strangers in places we’d frequent. I’d always wonder, “How did my *Paati* get so lucky?”.

I was raised by my *Thatha* and *Paati* because both my parents had to work a little extra to support the family. I also had my uncle and aunt, who were very young back then. They used to tell us bedtime stories, feed us even if we’re throwing the most ridiculous tantrums, buy us the hottest new wind-up toy out in the market or simply mollycoddle us to no end.

But, *Thatha* was always my favourite.

He used to sing, write his own songs, he practiced Homeopathy, knew so much about so many different things and everything I cover here is a severe under representation of all the things that he was into. He was always good at anything he picked.

I never once felt like I missed out on anything. Through multiple house shifts, weddings and other significant life changes, we always had each other; me, my siblings, *Thatha* and *Paati*.

But like most good things, this too came to an end.

I spent most of my *Thatha’s* later years in different hospitals trying to decipher what new thing each doctor had to say. I was quite happy even in the hospital. I had seen this happen before — he always gets better and comes back home with something new to laugh about. He always gets better.

Well, this time, he didn’t.

I never spent much time with *Paati* when *Thatha* was around. So, I never knew how to comfort her when he wasn’t. She always seemed like the silent type. On any given point in time, you can find her in the kitchen, making us our 15th cup of coffee for the day or picking flowers that will later be used to make a garland for the gods.

You could easily miss her in a room with Thatha. He’d be stealing all the focus while she smiles silently on the sidelines.

My siblings and I continued to stay with *Paati*. It took us a few months to realize that she’s far from silent. She can speak about the star patterns, she knows about the moon’s waxing and waning periods and she can discuss endlessly about the philosophy behind Mahabharata.

She remembers birthdays, wedding anniversaries, first-day-of-work days and pretty much any detail even if it goes beyond a few decades. She journals religiously and makes a list of interesting things from her daily exchanges to go back and read when she feels like it.

She continued the tradition of telling us bedtime stories. Her favourites were things from her younger years — her siblings, her friends, her first job, her last job and everything in between. *Paati* is very smart. You cannot fool her. This wasn’t a quality that thrilled me in my teen years but now, I’ve grown to adore it. Even admire it.

*Paati* is curious about the tiniest of things. She’ll ask you a lot of questions. She’s not shy to admit that she doesn’t know something. She understands politics and comes up with her own conspiracy theories. She’s fiercely loyal to her beliefs and will love you endlessly even if you don’t share them.

I never saw until now how dependent my *Thatha* was on my *Paati*. He knew he couldn’t be everything he was without her.

My siblings have started lives of their own. Now, it’s just me and *Paati* in the same house that my siblings and I hosted our first water-gun fight. *Paati* and I discuss cooking, exchange recipes, books and other things. I’ve caught her singing while she cooks. I’ve caught her laughing at her phone as she scrolls through memes. I’ve seen her read books faster than I ever could. We have movie nights and have pop-corn together. We laugh out loud together. She knows all of my friends by their names and even knows their little quirks. She knows what they like and continues to force-feed them every time they’re home. They don’t complain.

Growing up, I always saw *Thatha* as my hero. But, I realise now just how much of a hero *Paati* has always been.
