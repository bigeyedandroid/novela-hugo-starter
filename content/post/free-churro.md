Context: I attended a [https://indiauncut.com/clear-writing/](https://indiauncut.com/clear-writing/). We were asked to work on an exercise - Switching the POV of a scene from a movie, book or TV Show. More often than not, a scene is told from one person's perspective, the exercise was for us to pick a different character from the scene and rewrite it. I picked ‚ÄúFree Churro‚Äù, which is an episode from BoJack Horseman, the TV show.

I like funerals. This was my closure. I was not going to miss this one. It had only been a few days since I last saw Beatrice. Saw her alive, I mean.

She didn‚Äôt smile this time. She seems content though.

She was happy when I came for her. I am not used to that. She muttered ‚ÄúI see you‚Äù a few times in gentle notes. In my line of work, people tend to not see me. It‚Äôs for the best. Helps me collect their souls without much hassle. That was my experience with Beatrice.

This was a funeral like no other. The setting was quiet. Too eery even for me. I didn‚Äôt see a picture of Beatrice around. Just a casket with some flowers. One would wonder if they really wanted to arrange a funeral. The answer became apparent after BoJack started his eulogy.

You could tell he was her son. He had all the markers, the careless stance, the bitter sighs, the anxious twitches and cold walls he drew around everyone. But today, was different. Unnatural to his usual stoic self, he looked happy. I don‚Äôt think these people understand funerals.

This was my fourth time seeing BoJack. He stood firm at the podium in his steel grey suit, the only one he had. He‚Äôd cleaned up well this time, far from his usual slacker form. You know he was trying to do this right. Whatever right meant for him. He stared for a while at the casket nodding and sighing like he was having a conversation with his mom. Or was that a glare?

And then he began his eulogy. Funerals are meant to be big but I was not too surprised that this one was not. This was a family that could barely talk to each other, leave alone make friends outside. The croaks and chatter died down. Why was a group of lizards at a horse‚Äôs funeral anyway?

Should have guessed that BoJack wouldn‚Äôt have nice things to say. This was instead an ugly series of incidents recounting careless parenting. He seemed to enjoy this. He casually directed the quintet to drop a note or a drumroll every time he made a joke. And there were plenty. He was a performer and you could see it.

He went on a rager for 17 minutes and 23 seconds. Yes, I counted. You don‚Äôt see this happen often. It was like a band performing with a carefully curated setlist. He knew he‚Äôd get his time to vent and this was it. Except, this was with an audience and not a therapist.

But in all the sadistic glee of his mother‚Äôs death, one could not skip the hint of yearn and gloom. He said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the kind of story I want to tell about my parents. But I don‚Äôt have those stories.‚Äù

He only paused to take a sip of alcohol. For a raging alcoholic, you‚Äôd expect him to down the bottle but he was strangely calm. Almost, liberated.

What got to me however was what he said between the ugly stories. He said with absolute certainty that we don‚Äôt keep a waitlist. That‚Äôs how I knew that this was going to be my strangest funeral.

Little did he know he was the next on my list.
