He sat in the corner

wincing in pain.

He tried so hard

but happiness, he couldn't feign.

He was painfully reminded

of tales from before.

Of all that he did

and his reasons, so sure.

But "I did what I could",

he screamed into the room.

He got no witty response,

not even an echo from this tomb.

He longed for something

anything, really.

Even just to hear the voices

of his dead and dearly.

This confinement was

not solitary.

With every second,

it seemed more contrary.

"But who am I speaking to?"

He screamed again.

"I could swear there was someone!"

His weeping began.

As the solitary resident

of this grand mausoleum

He never heard anyone

or anything, even.

Yet, he heard the questions,

the judgements and the whispers.

Nudging him to think

of all things sinister.

He cried again,

this time with no shame.

A prisoner of war,

he thus became.
