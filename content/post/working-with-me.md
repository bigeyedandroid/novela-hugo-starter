# Working With Me

When I first heard someone pitching a "Working with me" guide, I couldn't help but feel a bit of judgement for someone pitching what could have been the most narcissistic thing ever.

But, I realized that regardless of whether you have this written down, everyone is just trying to figure out ways to work better, with you or someone else.

This should either help someone or not. But I'd like to run this as an experiment to see if this helps my existing work relationships or not.

I also decided to put this out in public should anyone else want to use this as a template. This is also me feeding my very large ego and making myself seem more important than I actually am. Enjoy.

***

##### Self-motivated

I enjoy learning new things. It is one of the biggest reasons I choose to be a generalist. I like the challenge of learning something new and get better at it (read: best). I am wired to compete. Something that a picked up as a kid from a very stereotypical Indian family. I very rarely need motivation / sugar-coated pushes to drive me to do my job.

##### Ownership

Given that I wear multiple hats very frequently, I tend to take my job more seriously. For the fear of failing or letting my team down. So, I am naturally inclined to own anything I take for whatever reason.

I do not tolerate people treating others as someone beneath themselves for any reason. So even if you‚Äôre a senior at work and I see/hear you treating someone else as someone beneath your rank (whether it is intentional or not), I will make sure you hear from me about it.

##### Value Time

I value both my and others‚Äô time a lot. And I like it when others do the same. So, if we‚Äôve scheduled a meeting for 1 hr, I‚Äôd respect you more if we stuck to it unless of course I have nowhere else to be and we have more to discuss.

##### Direct

I pride myself in how direct I am. It keeps things transparent and it is the only way I know how to work. Over the years. I have learned the difference between being direct and rude and have to the best of my knowledge not crossed that line (both at work and otherwise). So, I always welcome the same treatment for me. I don‚Äôt like people sugarcoating anything. If you want to tell me anything at all, please be direct. I will also encourage you to help me find ways to improve.

##### No small talk

I really despise small talk. I prefer it if people got to the point and we had candid discussions instead of a random ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù and such. (even if you and I are friends, let‚Äôs have normal conversations, please? ü•≤)

##### Feedback

Feedback is a gift. I live and learn with feedback. Some of my major growth areas have been the effect of some really carefully thought-out and delivered feedback. And I am eternally grateful for it.

Please don't shy away from telling me that I am wrong or can improve or anything at all. I understand that I have a long way to go and knowing me, I will always have a long way to go.

And I want you to be a part of my journey in whatever way possible. And I promise you that you will be heard.

Even if I don't fully agree with you, I will definitely listen, introspect and act on (if I agree) whatever feedback I receive.

##### Freedom

I have had the privilege of working with some really amazing bosses and peers. I value freedom and have seen that I don‚Äôt do well in a micro-managed setting. Micro-management is a reflection of lack of trust. And trust is a two-way street. I understand that trust takes time but if your management style doesn't evolve with time & the value I provide, then I might not be able to provide the best value.

(P.S. This is taking into account you've not brought up any major feedback concerning my outcomes)

##### Relationships

I have learnt that we are nothing without the people around us who support us everyday. I appreciate people who put in the effort to build a good relationship. I always make sure to build a good rapport with people I work with simply because that is the culture I like. If I enjoy working with you, you will know. If I don‚Äôt, you will know. But not for the lack of trying.
