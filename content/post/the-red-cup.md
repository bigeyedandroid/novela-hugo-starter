She stuck her 4 fingers and 2 thumbs out to sign out the number 6 in an effort to answer the guest’s question. The house was hosting two new guests. She’d never seen them before. But as protocol follows, she knew the red cups would be out soon.

She loved the red cup. It was just solid blood-red. The nice kind with no other prints or colours. Just plain beautiful red. She always wanted to have her chocolate milk in it. But her parents always told her that it was for guests only. She always wondered why.

Every time the red cups came out, she’d be reminded of her mom’s earlier lectures about how we need to treat guests like they were the gods we pray to. She would argue, “Why would the gods care what cups they’re served in?”, only to be silenced by her mom’s harsh shush.

Can a 6-year old really win with her mom?

This time, she didn’t see the red cups come out. Instead, just steel tumblers like _she_ uses at home. Suddenly thrown into confusion, she just looks around frantically for her mom. Her mom seems calm. But why? Doesn’t she understand that these people need to be given the fancy red cup? They _are_ guests, aren’t they?

Her suspicion began to grow and she started intently listening to the adults conversing. It wasn’t too long until she found out that the lady in pink was her mom’s colleague. The man she came with is her husband.

They were discussing the news. Something about how things were _right_ the way they were. What does that even mean?

Soon after, they ended with a note on the upcoming elections and dad said “Vote _Right_!” and the entire party burst out in laughter. My mom got her red powder thing and offered it to the lady in pink. She never does this with others. Strange.

The latest guests were soon followed by another lady who’d come in to meet her mom. Out came the red cups. Things were slightly different this time. Her mom wasn’t as close to the new lady. Her dad even got a steel chair from inside, said a quick hello and offered the chair for the lady. Things were different. Why do they not let her sit on the sofa like they let the lady in pink and her husband?

After a quick conversation, the lady left and this time, she was not offered the red powder for her head.

Was she a lesser god?

So, she resigned to her small corner to sip her chocolate milk from a cup that her adult parents deemed appropriate for her. The chocolate milk would taste the same in a red cup as it does in a steel tumbler. So how did we go about deciding who gets what?
